# Digging deeper into Data Scientists and Data Analysts job postings

<p>Data scientists, data analysts, and other related job titles are in high demand, and there is no lack of articles and blog posting suggesting all the technical, statistical, and programming skills that an 'ideal' fill in the blank (data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, business analyst...) should have. But what are companies really looking for in their 'ideal' candidate?, what are the skills that I need to hone to get that job?</p>

<p>The purpose of the following report is to analyze 80 postings for data scientists and data analysts jobs in Austin, TX, along with 50 announcements for data visualization specialists, to find exactly the skills companies are looking for and the words they used to describe their 'ideal' candidate.</p>

<p>I used various python packages including Pandas, Altair, BeautifulSoup and NLTK, to do natural language processing and analyze job postings for data scientists and data analysts.</p>
