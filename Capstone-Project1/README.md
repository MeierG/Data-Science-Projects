# Predicting Restaurant Inspection Results

<p>The goal of this analysis is to use publicly available data from restaurant inspection results from the Southern Nevada Health District and Yelp’s data on businesses and consumers’ ratings, to predict non-compliant results and help optimize and prioritize inspection visits.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis is that holding everything else constant, the probability that a restaurant receives a passing grade is the same for all restaurants, independent of the month the inspection takes place, the location, restaurant's attributes, their Yelp's stars ratings, business ratings, review counts, type of food, or review counts.</p>

<p>The alternative hypothesis is that there is a statistically significant difference between the attributes of a restaurant that have passing grades and those with downgrades.</p>
