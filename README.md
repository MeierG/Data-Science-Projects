# Data Science Projects Repository
The following repository contains several data science projects using SQL based analysis and Python for data science, including:

## <a href= 'https://github.com/MeierG/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Capstone-Project'> Capstone Project: Predicting Critical Health and Safety Violations at Food Establishments</a>
<p>The goal of this analysis is to use publicly available data from restaurant inspection results from the Southern Nevada Health District and Yelp’s data on businesses and consumers’ ratings, to predict non-compliant results and help optimize and prioritize inspection visits.</p>

<p><b>Skills</b>: API, JSON, EDA, Inferential Statistics, Machine Learning.</p>

<p><b>Libraries</b>: Pandas, NumPy, Requests, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.</p>

## <a href = 'https://github.com/MeierG/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Capstone-report-data-analytics-masters/Predicting-Home-Prices-Using-Employment-Indicators.pdf'>Data Analytics Master's Capstone: Predicting home prices using employment indicators</a>
<p>Through exploratory data analysis and three separate predictive models, this report examines the relationship between employment and median housing prices in metropolitan areas in the United States, and how employment by industry influences
housing prices. </p>
<p>The machine learning portion, uses Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Multiple Linear Regression models in SAS EM to predict median housing prices by economic regions in the U.S., using workforce indicators and historical housing data. All models obtained over 70% predictive accuracy and the RMSE was used to evaluate performance.</p>

<p><b>Skills</b>: API, JSON, EDA, Inferential Statistics, Machine Learning.</p>
<p><b>Tools:</b>: R, Python, Tableau, SAS Enterprise miner, REST APIs</p>

<p><b><em>Skills:</em></b> API, JSON, EDA, Inferential Statistics, Machine Learning.</p>
<p><b><em>Libraries:</em></b> Pandas, NumPy, Requests, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.</p>

## <a href='https://github.com/MeierG/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/EDA-human-temperature/Body_Temperatures.ipynb'>What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?</a>
<p>The objective of this analysis is to determine wheter the human temperature is statistically significantly different from the 98.6 F  reported by Carl Wunderlich.</p>
<p><b>Skills:</b> hyphotesis testing, one-sample hypothesis test, bootstraping, bootstrap replicates, test statistics, confidence intervals, and permutation.</p>

## <a href = 'https://github.com/MeierG/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/EDA-racial-discrimination/EDA-racial-discrimination.ipynb'>Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market</a>

<p>The goal of this analysis is to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.</p>
<p><b>Skills:</b> hyphotesis testing, one-sample hypothesis test, bootstraping, bootstrap replicates, test statistics, confidence intervals, and permutation.</p>
